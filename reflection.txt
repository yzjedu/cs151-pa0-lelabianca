This isn’t necessarily my first rodeo when it comes to working for clients, even in the specific field of computer science. I’ve worked in internships with sizeable tech conglomerates in the past, namely Carahsoft. However, my knowledge of coding, which could be chalked up to effectively zero, prevented me from feeling like I learned or attained anything of use. Maybe that was the idea all along. In this project, however, I get to work on something that is at my individual skill level and actually be of use to someone I know, as opposed to a faceless tech company. It definitely felt much better than working at the company. In truth, in contrast to working with Korede, working as an individual on this project didn’t feel very different. The only real difference was that I felt it went a little bit faster, but I guess that was mostly just because I was doing everything myself, occupied at every turn of the product, as opposed to turning the keys over to my partner from time to time. I think all in all I preferred doing it as an individual just because of the perceived speed and time, but I don’t think I would ever really deliberately choose this method over doing it in pairs or groups all things considered. I hadn’t really learned anything new about programming specifically in this projects that the lectures or textbook assignments hadn’t already taught me, but I did learn how to interact more personally with a client, which is something I only half did at my internship. In terms of things I would do different next time, I think I might have tried to figure out a way to get the program to create an if else statement to loop back and repeat the input push if the number is less than or equal to zero to prevent weird or nonsensical answers.
